       "  Borrower added on 09/27/12 > My husband and I just moved.  Once we moved in we realized that we needed new appliances and new flooring.  There were some other minor repairs we had to make and we want to have the inside painted as well.  We want to pay off credit cards and cover home improvement and moving costs.   Thank you!<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
