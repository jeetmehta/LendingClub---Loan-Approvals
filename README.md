# Data Challenge - LendingClub Loan Approvals

## Problem
The goal of this data challenge is to utilize the given dataset, sample applicant data from the LendingClub portfolio, and utilize that data to create a model that can assess whether LendingClub should issue a loan to the applicant. The dataset includes a wide variety of information on the applicant, some of which is personal and other information that is more situational/operational in nature.

Let's go through a typical data science process (Clean -> Explore -> Analyse -> Model -> Evaluate) with this dataset!

## Analysis

The analysis presented in the notebook will answer the following questions:

- Simplifying Assumptions
- Modifications to Dataset (i.e. Imputations, Transforming Categoricals etc.)
- Plots
- Model Performance

## Tools

In terms of software tools utilized, they are:
- Jupyter Notebook (where the code + analysis resides)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Running the Notebook

Viewing/running the notebook is as simple as:

    jupyter notebook

Navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and simply launch it!

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed going through this problem! I'm excited to get feedback on my work here, learn how about how I can contribute towards the work at LendUp! Thanks so much for the opportunity!
